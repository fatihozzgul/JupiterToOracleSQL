# JupiterToOracleSQL
This code establishes a connection between Jupyter Notebook and Oracle SQL

You can follow the steps below to connect Oracle SQL via Jupyter Notebook:

First, create the Oracle data source (DSN) required to access the Oracle SQL database. To do this, open the "ODBC Data Source Administrator" application and click the "Add" button to create the Oracle data source.

Install the cx_Oracle Python package by running the "!pip install cx_Oracle" command on Jupyter Notebook. This package is required to establish a connection to the Oracle database.

Now you can go to jupytertooraclesql.ipynb .
